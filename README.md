# Summary

## Data Sampling
The Data Sampling notebook is to sample the images into training and validation

1. Create training data and validation data folder
2. Sample # number of images for each type of skin disease to create a balanced training dataset
3. Sample # number of images (based on the length from 20% of the training dataset) for each type of skin disease to create a validation dataset 
4. Save training and validation images into training and validation folder

Note: When running the notebook, it creates the training and the validation folder. If you want to sample the dataset again, delete the training and the validation folder before sampling.
